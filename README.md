* You can execute all requests in non-user-restricted endpoints without a token.
* To create an account, use the [Create User](/docs/user_add.md) route.
* Then, use the [Login request](/docs/login.md) route to get a JWT Token.
* You can then use this token as "Bearer Token" Authentication to have access to user-restricted routes, such as article creation and edition.
* Always use raw JSON data for POST and PUT requests instead of form data.
